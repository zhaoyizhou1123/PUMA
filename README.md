## Overview

**PUMA (Progressive Unmasking)** is a simple modification to the forward process of **Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)**.
Instead of training on randomly masked sequences, PUMA aligns that training- and inference- time masking patterns, thereby focusingon inference-aligned masks and speeding up training.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Environment

```bash
# Create and activate conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

The slurm training script (see below) activates the environment automatically. To activate manually, run:

```bash
conda activate puma
```

### 2. Data preparation
We provide PUMA codebases for Sudoku and TinyGSM. 

- Sudoku: Download *sudoku-train-data.npy* and *sudoku-test-data.npy* from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TluiZjYl-zLdbxjVmhfWl-WyX_OvD7UW) and put them in the `data/sudoku_new` folder. 

- TinyGSM: Run `data/tiny_gsm.py` that gives you files `labels.bin`, `meta.json`, and `prompt_mask.bin` for pretraining in the desired `out_dir` directory.

### 3. Run Training
Submit a job using the SLURM script:

```bash
sbatch job.sh
```

The SLURM script calls `train.py`, which handles the training loop.

### 4. Configuration

Config files are located in `yaml_files/`. Edit these YAML files to adjust:
- Model architecture
- Training hyperparameters  
- Dataset settings
- Logging options

We provide one config each for PUMA and the baseline for the following three settings: Sudoku, TinyGSM (standard), TinyGSM (block diffusion).

Please note that you need to update `wandb.entity` in the config, as well user-specific settings such as `account` and `partition` in `job.sh`, before launching a training run.

To train a block diffusion model, run `train_block.py` instead of `train.py`.

For ARM initialization, first pretrain an ARM model by setting `model.causal=true` in the config, and then initialize an MDM by setting `model.arm_init` in the config, and resetting `model.causal` to `false`.

### 5. Monitoring

Training logs and checkpoints are saved according to the paths specified in your config file. The training file also logs results to wandb.

## Explanation of each files
- `train.py`: unified file that handles the MDM pretraining (includes the vanilla MDM pretraining). Includes evaluation accuracy logging. This file is used for both Sudoku and TinyGSM, but not block diffusion.
- `train_block.py`: Training file for MDM pretraining in the block diffusion setting.
- `sampling.py`: sampling for a given MDM
- `progressive.py`': PUMA via batch streaming implementation. The implementation detail can be found in Section 3.2 and Appendix B.1.
- `progressive_block.py`: PUMA implementation for block diffusion. 
- `model`: our Qwen2-style attention implementations
- `eval`: eval util functions for Sudoku / TinyGSM
